Password Program

Use the passwords.txt file containing names and passwords.

Write an InputChecker Service Class which asks the User to enter their name and Password and checks if they are valid.
If the input is invalid, ask the user to try again.

IF the User enters the wrong name/password (can be either or both), allow the User to re-try only ONCE.
Semicolons are not allowed to be used as characters in the name or password.
Ask User if he/she wants to check, if the name is in the Database. So User can check before Using the retry.
If not allow User to write in their selected name and password. Numeric Characters are not allowed at as first Character.
It should be written in passwords.txt file separated by a semicolon.

If the User still cannot enter the correct name/password, display the following:
"Sorry, your username/password does not match our database. Contact the administrator."
